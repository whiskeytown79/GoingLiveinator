This app is going to let you put in a "going live" message, along with your stream
link, and optionally an image, and then post it to various discords, twitter etc.

To do this, it will need to use OAuth to post to discord and twitter on the
user's behalf.

Auth:
- Implement OAuth API access for Discord
- Implement OAuth API access for Twitter
- We should never need the user to supply any credentials to this app - OAuth authorization
  will be done with Discord and Twitter's existing OAuth flows, probably in the user's browser
- Make sure OAuth tokens are stored securely

Content:
- Receive paste of text for going live message
- Receive paste of image for optional image

Configuration:
- Allow adding new destinations (Discord server/channel, or Twitter account, etc)
- Allow configuration of how message appears
- Maybe a template, like "{message} - {streamUrl}{optionalImageData}"
- Allow configuring whether to show the URL preview when also including an image (Discord)

Posting:
- Show progress and success/problem for each configured destination

Future features:
- Support YouTube streams in addition to Twitch streams
- Other announcement destinations? (Instagram, Facebook, etc?)
